# CDF Hacktoberfest Information
Information and guidelines for participating in the CDF's Hacktoberfest program

## Where to work

In order to receive CDF-tracked points for your open source GitHub contribution activity during Hacktoberfest, you must work in one of the tracked organizations. These include CDF project organzations:

- [Jenkins](https://github.com/jenkinsci)
- [Jenkins X](https://github.com/jenkins-x)
- [Screwdriver](https://github.com/screwdriver-cd)
- [Spinnaker](https://github.com/spinnaker)
- [Tekton](https://github.com/tektoncd)

And this organization:
- [CDF-Hacktoberfest](https://github.com/cdf-hacktoberfest)

To build demos, plugins, or automation that are related to CDF projects but cannot be immediately contributed to the project organizations themselves, create repositories to store the work in this [cdf-hacktoberfest](https://github.com/cdf-hacktoberfest) organization. Content contributions like blog posts, solution briefs, whitepapers, training resources, or video scripts should also be initiated as respositories in the [cdf-hacktoberfest](https://github.com/cdf-hacktoberfest) organization. This will facilitate easy tracking and review of all contributions from the participating CDF community. All participants will be added to the [cdf-hacktoberfest](https://github.com/cdf-hacktoberfest) organization after checking in to the event and providing a GitHub username on the [check-in form](link@link.com).
